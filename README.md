## 📊 Executive Summary

This project is an institutional-grade options analytics engine designed to price, analyze, and stress-test equity derivatives. Unlike simple Black-Scholes calculators, this engine incorporates **Volatility Skew**, **Sensitivity Analysis**, and **Dynamic Hedging** strategies to provide a complete risk profile for NVDA options.

It was built as a submission for the National Hackathon 2026, demonstrating professional-level quantitative finance capabilities.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Advanced Pricing Models
- **Black-Scholes-Merton** implementation for European options.
- **Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)** analysis comparing Implied vs. Realized volatility.
- **Skew Analysis**: Automated detection of Put vs. Call implied volatility spreads.

### 2. Risk Management (Greeks)
- **Robust Calculation**: `GreeksCalculator` uses analytical derivatives rather than finite differences for precision.
- **Trader-Centric Units**: Normalizes mathematical outputs (e.g., Vega as "Dollars per 1% Vol") for immediate decision making.
- **Delta-Neutral Hedging**: Automated calculation of share requirements to hedge directional risk.

### 3. Stress Testing & Scenarios
- **Non-Linear Re-pricing**: The `ScenarioEngine` performs full Black-Scholes re-calculation for every scenario, capturing convexity (Gamma/Speed) that linear models miss.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: 2D parameter sweeps for Volatility (50-200%) and Time Decay.
- **Tail Risk**: Simulates extreme events like "Vol Crush" and "Market Crashes".
- **Model Limitations**: Professional consulting memo detailing assumptions and tail risks.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

### Precision over Approximation
While many tools use linear approximations (Delta/Gamma) for risk estimation, this engine re-calculates exact Black-Scholes prices for every scenario. This ensures accuracy even during extreme market moves where convexity breaks linear models.

### Actionable Intelligence
The system doesn't just output numbers; it contextualizes them.
- **Unit Normalization**: Converting raw Greeks into "Trader Units" (e.g., Vega as "Dollars per 1% Vol").
- **Consulting Memo**: Automatically generating a plain-English risk report summarizing the "So What?" of the data.
